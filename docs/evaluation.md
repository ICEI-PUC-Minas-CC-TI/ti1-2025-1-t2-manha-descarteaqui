Evaluation Criteria
1. Project Organization (Score: 7/10)
Strengths:
The project is well-structured with clear separation of concerns (e.g., public for frontend, db for data, docs for documentation).
Use of subdirectories like assets, modulos, and css in public helps maintain modularity.
The README.md files provide some guidance on usage and structure.
Weaknesses:
The naming conventions are inconsistent (e.g., TIAW - Orientação de Avaliação - TEMPLATE.docx vs. TIAW - Planejamento Sprint.docx).
Some files, like db.json and quizes.json, are not clearly documented in terms of their purpose or structure.
The README.md contains placeholder text (e.g., "⚠️ APAGUE ESSA PARTE ANTES DE ENTREGAR SEU TRABALHO"), which indicates incomplete documentation.
2. Code Quality (Score: 6/10)
Strengths:
The JavaScript code uses modern async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
Functions like addMarkersForTrashType and showTrashDetails are modular and focused on specific tasks.
Weaknesses:
There are comments indicating unoptimized code (e.g., "optimize search | at the moment is making a new request for each selected value").
Lack of error handling in critical areas (e.g., fetch calls do not handle network errors or invalid responses).
The code lacks unit tests or any form of automated testing.
Inline styles in JavaScript (e.g., html: <div style="...">) should be avoided in favor of CSS classes for maintainability.
3. Documentation (Score: 5/10)
Strengths:
The README.md provides a good starting point for understanding the project's context, objectives, and methodology.
The inclusion of wireframes, personas, and user flows demonstrates an effort to align design and development.
Weaknesses:
Many sections in the documentation are incomplete or contain placeholder text (e.g., "✳️✳️✳️ COLOQUE AQUI O DIAGRAMA DE FLUXO DE TELAS ✳️✳️✳️").
The technical documentation for APIs and data structures (e.g., quizes.json) is missing.
The README.md files lack detailed instructions for setting up and running the project in different environments.
4. Consistency (Score: 6/10)
Strengths:
The use of consistent folder structures (e.g., assets/css, assets/js) is commendable.
The design elements (e.g., #info-container, #map-container) show some alignment with the project's goals.
Weaknesses:
Variable naming is inconsistent (e.g., selectedValue vs. selectedCity vs. element).
The CSS files use hardcoded values (e.g., background-color: #ffffff) instead of leveraging CSS variables consistently.
Some files, like site-data.js, have incomplete or unclear functions (e.g., tiposLixo(callback) with no implementation provided).
5. Alignment with Objectives (Score: 7/10)
Strengths:
The project aligns well with its stated goals of promoting environmental awareness and providing a platform for locating waste disposal points.
Features like filtering by trash type and displaying details of collection points are directly relevant to the objectives.
Weaknesses:
The educational aspect (e.g., "Permitir que o usuário acesse conteúdos educativos sobre reciclagem") is not fully implemented or visible in the provided code.
The user experience could be improved with better error messages, loading indicators, and responsiveness.
Overall Score: 6/10

Include a setup guide for developers and deployment instructions.
Testing:

Introduce unit tests for critical functions (e.g., addMarkersForTrashType, showTrashDetails).
Add integration tests to ensure the frontend and backend work seamlessly.
Consistency:

Standardize naming conventions for variables, files, and folders.
Use CSS variables for colors and other reusable styles.
User Experience:

Improve the responsiveness of the interface, especially for mobile devices.
Add loading indicators and error messages to enhance usability.
Feature Completeness:
